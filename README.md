DMU Kinematics PJT

---
## 🧩 Engineering Focus
- DMU reliability 
*Focus on long-life infrastructure engineering. Emphasis on maintainability, reliability, and realistic constraints.*
---
## Problem
- Van Tailgate + Strut Assembly Kinematics Simulation (End Point : 2 end ball joints w/van body + van tailgate) 
---
## Constraints
- Can not simulate "ball joint" constrains but resolved
---
## Approach
- CATIA V5
---
## Analysis
- At least 4 constrains and at least 3 external command needed
